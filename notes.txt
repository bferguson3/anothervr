everyone takes up one square on a grid. 
  you can only play one HERO at a time.
  OR: teleport between hero 'minds'. not sure how good that will work

defend only requires holding the defensive item against the attack spot.
it reduces the incoming attack damage by a certain amount.
magic can only be defended by a book.

parry requires a swing motion against the incoming attack 'spot'. 
it will return a certain amount of damage to the attacker, but if you fail
you take full damage.
magic can only be parried by staff.

COLLISION FOR PARRY:
timestamp 0: get xyz of wrist and of tip of weapon.
timestamp 1: get xyz of wrist and tip of weapon, and form a polygon.
 does this polygon intersect with the trigger spot?
if no, use the next ts's position as ts1, and this ts's as ts0,
 continue...

models are like pools of radiance models, or demeo, or tabletop tales. Static 
3d models on 'discs'. 

encounters could be different map or same...

* RANGED attacks can be physically dodged. this is because trajectory can be calculated. 
  MELEE attacks cannot. There's no animation to dodge.
